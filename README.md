# Note Book 📝

Hey! This is a simple, private note-taking app I built just for myself. I wanted something clean, fast, and fully local—no cloud, no accounts, just my notes.

If you're looking for a minimal place to jot down thoughts, code snippets, or life plans, feel free to use it!

## Features

- **🎨 Dynamic Colors**: Tags have distinct colors from a rich palette of 18 Material shades, and your notes automatically adopt them.
- **🏷️ Smart Tagging**: Organize everything with color-coded tags.
- **📝 Markdown Support**: Write in Markdown with a live preview. Bold, italic, lists, code blocks—it's all there.
- **🔒 Fully Local**: Your data stays on your device. Always.
- **💾 Auto-Save**: Never lose a thought.
- **🌓 Dark Mode**: Looks great at night. (And follows your system theme perfectly).
- **📱 Floating Toolbar**: Formatting tools are always within reach but never in the way.
- **📤 Import/Export**: Backup your notes to a JSON file and take them anywhere.
