# Note Book 📝

Hey! This is a simple, private note-taking app I built just for myself. I wanted something clean, fast, and fully local—no cloud, no accounts, just my notes.

If you're looking for a minimal place to jot down thoughts, code snippets, or life plans, feel free to use it!

## Features

- **🎨 Deep Customization**: Notes adapt their entire color scheme (page, background, formatting) based on the tag color you choose.
- **🏷️ Smart Tagging**: Organize with color-coded tags that influence the note's look.
- **📝 Rich Editor**: WYSIWYG editor with adaptive code/quote styling and uniform toolbars.
- **🖼️ Image Support**: Add images that appear as rounded thumbnails on the dashboard and fully immersive previews in the editor.
- **📂 Organization**: Archive old notes or standard Trash bin (soft delete).
- **🔒 Fully Local**: Your data stays on your device. Always.
- **💾 Auto-Save**: Never lose a thought.
- **🌓 Dark Mode**: Looks great at night. (And follows your system theme perfectly).
- **📱 Floating Toolbar**: Formatting tools are always within reach but never in the way.
- **📤 Import/Export**: Backup your notes to a JSON file and take them anywhere.
