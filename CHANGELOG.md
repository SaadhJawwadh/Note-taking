# Changelog

## [1.7.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- **Monochrome Branding**: Updated home screen title to "Note book" to reflect the new brand identity.
- **Adaptive Formatting**: Note Editor quote and code blocks now dynamically adapt their colors (text, background, border) to match the note's specific page color or system theme.
- **Thumbnail View**: Home screen note cards now display images as compact 120px thumbnails with rounded corners, distinct from the full 200px preview in the editor.

### Changed
- **Editor Toolbar layout**: Standardized spacing in the bottom toolbar to providing a uniform, evenly distributed look for all formatting icons.
- **Tag Filtering**: "All Notes" filter is now simply labeled "All" for a cleaner UI.
- **Image Previews**: Unified image preview styling across the app (full width, rounded corners) while maintaining context-appropriate heights.

### Fixed
- **Layout Overflow**: Resolved a RenderFlex overflow issue in Home Screen note cards layout.
- **Dark Mode Visibility**: Fixed visibility issues with quote formatting in dark mode.
